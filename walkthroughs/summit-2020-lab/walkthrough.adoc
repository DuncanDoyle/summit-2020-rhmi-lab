= Red Hat Summit 2020 RHMI Lab

Welcome to the Red Hat Summit 2020 Red Hat Managed Integration Lab!

Red Hat Managed Integration (RHMI) delivers cloud-based agile integration services hosted on OpenShift Dedicated (OSD). Using RHMI we can create consistent, immediately available, managed environments so that development teams can more easily build enterprise applications on OpenShift.
These environments accelerate engagement timelines, reduce operational risk and cost, and address the needs of the evolving enterprise integration market.

In this lab youâ€™re tasked with building out a real-time IoT traffic and parking meter management solution for the city of Los Angeles - don't worry we'll be helping you along the way!

The tasks you'll perform include:

{blank}

* Data ingestion of real time traffic and parking meter data from AMQ Streams into a Postgres Database using Red Hat Fuse Online
* Definition of an OpenAPI compatible API Spec using Red Hat API Designer
* Deployment of a ready-made API using your choice of Runtime technologies - Fuse or Node.js
* Protection of the API using 3scale API Management
* Visualisation of the data from the API via a front end web app based on React.js and Patternfly.js

{blank}

To get you started, you will be provided with the following infrastructure:

* An AMQ Streams instance with 2 topics - {streams-junction-topic-name} and {streams-meter-topic-name}. These topics will be connected to a live stream of IoT data which needs to be ingested
* A Postgres server with two databases:
- A pre-populated Lookup database containing reference data which maps incoming Ids for traffic junctions and parking meters to their corresponding names and geo locations
- An empty database, with pre defined schemas for storing the live IoT traffic and sensor data
* Access to the Red Hat API Designer tool for exploring the OpenAPI Spec compatible API definition
* Implementation of the API Server Node.js which will have the API definition implemented and connectivity to Postgres pre-configured
* Access to 3scale API Management service for protecting your API
* An implementation of the front end web app with a API calls implemented

{blank}

The architecture diagram below provides an overview of the complete solution. Data is flowing from the right to left in the diagram.

== Data Ingestion from AMQ Streams to Postgres using Fuse Online

Fuse Online is an enterprise integration platform that provides connectors for many services, such as AMQ Streams and Postgres.
In this section we will create two *Connections* - one to AMQ Streams and one to Postgres.
We will then create an *Integration* that uses these two connections and translates the incoming data from AMQ Streams into database *INSERT* statements on Postgres.

=== Creating the AMQ Streams Connector

. Log in to the link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank"] console. Login if prompted.

. Select *Connections* from the left hand menu.

. Select the *Create Connection* button to start the *Create Connection* wizard.

. When prompted with *Select Connector*, select *Kafka Message Broker*.

. When prompted with *Configure connection*:
.. Enter the following in the *Kafka Broker URIs* field:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
{kafka-broker-uri}
----
.. Click the *Validate* button to ensure the connection to AMQ Streams is configured correctly.
.. You should see the message `Kafka Message Broker has been successfully validated`.

== API Definition using Red Hat API Designer

Red Hat API Designer is a tool that provides the ability to create *OpenAPI Specification* compatible API definitions.
The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection.

When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.
An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.
For more information on the *OpenAPI Specification* see the link:{oas3-url}[Open API Specification, window="_blank"] on GitHub

In this section we will use the Red Hat API designer to explore a pre-built an OpenAPI Specification which is used in the implementation of our API Server.
The APIs created will combine data from the provided Lookup Tables in Postgres - *{postgres-junction-lookup-table}* and *{postgres-meter-lookup-table}* - with the data from the live junction and meter tables which is being ingested from AMQ Streams.

=== Viewing an Open API Spec

. Download the ZIP file containing the OpenAPI Spec from link:https://gist.github.com/evanshortiss/b658a32c4145e59525f90bbbec68db4a/archive/f0057efb472253b382b5a9a9150924359c558302.zip[this link].
. Unzip the file and open the resulting folder. It should contain a JSON file that holds that OpenAPI Spec data.
. Open the link:{apicurio-url}[Red Hat API Designer Dashboard] and click the *OpenAPI* button.
. When prompted to choose a file select the JSON file you just unzipped.

[type=verification]
Did the Red Hat API Designer UI render the OpenAPI Spec using the file you uploaded?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you selected the correct JSON file. If the OpenAPI Spec fails to render in Red Hat API Designer please contact the lab administrator.

=== View API Data Types

This API contains two primary data types, the *Junction* and *Meter*. Here's how you can view their properties using Red Hat API Designer.

. On the left-hand side of the Red Hat API Designer UI you should see a *Data Types* section after the OpenAPI Spec JSON was loaded.
. Choose the *Junction* item under the *Data Types* heading. Information and properties of a *Junction* are now displayed on the right of the Red Hat API Designer UI.
. Select the *Source* tab at the top of the right-hand pane to view the data that represents a *Junction* type in this OpenAPI Spec.
. Click the *As JSON* button on the right to toggle between JSON and YAML representations of the OpenAPI spec.
. Choose the *Meter* item under the *Data Types* heading.
. Note that the *Meter* has fewer properties than the *Junction*, but it utilises an *Enum* type to specify valid states that a Meter can be in.

=== API Paths

. Lastly, explore the four entries listed under the *Paths* heading and note that each path only supports *GET* requests since this going to be a readonly API.

[time=15]
== Deployment of the API Implementation
In this section you'll deploy a pre-built implementation of the OpenAPI Specification you explored in the previous section.

=== Connecting to Postgres

When deploying your the API server implementation, you will need to use the following details to connect your API Server to your Postgres DB:

. Username: `{postgres-username}`
. Password: `{postgres-password}`
. Hostname: `{postgres-hostname}`
. Database: `{postgres-database}`
. Port: `{postgres-port}`

{blank}

The *username* and *password* information will be provided to your API server via a *Secret* you will create in the OpenShift UI.

=== Create a DeploymentConfig

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console].
. Choose *Home > Projects* from the side menu and select your the {walkthrough-namespace} *Project* from the list. This will display the *Project Details* screen.
. Select the *Workloads* tab from the *Project Details* screen.
. Select *add other content* from the *Workloads* screen.
. Choose the *Container Image* option from the *Add* screen.
. On the *Deploy Image* screen enter the following:
.. For *Image Name* enter `quay.io/evanshortiss/summit-2020-rhmi-lab-nodejs-backend` and click the search icon to display the container image details.
.. Leave the *Name* and *Application Name* fields at their default values.
.. Under the *Resources* section Choose *DeploymentConfig* if prompted.
.. Leave the *Create a route to the application* box checked under the *Advanced Options* section.
. Finally, click *Create* to deploy the container image.

At this point you've successfully created a *DeploymentConfig* for your application, but it needs extra configuration to connect to the Postgres database.

=== Create a Secret

Secrets can be used to store sensitive information securely such that it's not visible in plaintext when interacting with the OpenShift Cluster.

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console].
. Choose *Home > Projects* from the side menu and select your *{user-project-name}* from the list. This will display the *Project Details* screen.
. Choose *Workloads > Secrets* and click the *Create > Key/Value Secret* button on the *Secrets* screen.
. Enter *pg-secrets* in the *Secret Name* field.
. Create a key named *username* with a value of `{postgres-username}`.
. Click *Add Key/Value* to create another key/value pair.
. Enter the key name of *password* with a value of `{postgres-password}`.
. Click *Create*.

[type=verification]
Is the Secret listed under *Workloads > Secrets*, and if you view it are the *username* and *password* values obscured in the OpenShift UI?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you're in the correct section of the OpenShift UI and followed the directions. If the Secret cannot be created or viewed please talk to your lab administrator.

=== Update the DeploymentConfig with the Postgres Secret

Now that you've created a *Secret* containing the database connection information it's time to put it to use.

The key/value pairs stored in the *Secret* can be associated with the *DeploymentConfig*, and exposed to the underlying application as *Environment Variables*.

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console].
. Choose *Workloads > DeploymentConfigs* from the side menu and verify the selected Project is set to *{user-project-name}* using the dropdown.
. Select the *{username}-traffic-api* item in the list. The *Deployment Config Details* screen is displayed.
. Select *Environment* tab and click *Add from ConfigMap or Secret*.
. In the new row, `PG_USERNAME` in the *name* field and select the *pg-secrets* resource and *username* key.
. Click *Add from ConfigMap or Secret* again.
. In the new row, `PG_PASSWORD` in the *name* field and select the *pg-secrets* resource and *password* key.
. Click the *Save* button.

=== Verify the Deployment

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console].
. Choose *Workloads > Pods* and verify the selected Project is set to *{user-project-name}* using the dropdown.
. You should see a *Pod* named *{username}-traffic-api* followed by a number in the list. The *Status* of this Pod should be *Running*.
. Choose *Networking > Routes* from the side menu and verify the selected Project is set to *{user-project-name}* using the dropdown.
. A route named *{username}-traffic-api* should be listed in a table.
. Click the URL listed under the *Location* to view the Swagger UI docs for your deployed Node.js API.

[type=verification]
Is a webpage with a Swagger UI and list of endpoints displayed in your web browser after opening the *Location* URL from the previous section?

[type=verificationFail]

Verify that the *Pod* you checked as part of *Verify the Deployment* is in a *Running* state. If the URL does not display a Swagger UI after a few moments contact the lab administrator.

[time=25]
== API Protection using 3scale API Management

In 3scale, we will be dealing with the following constructs:
. A *Product* defines the developer/consumer facing end service you wish to make available for consumption.
. A *Backend* defines the backend service(s) you wish to protect and make available via a *Product*.
. An *Applications* define the credentials (e.g. API Key) to access your API. Applications are stored within *Developer Accounts*.
. An *Application Plan* determines the access policies and is always associated with one *Application*.

In order to secure the traffic and parking meter service that was built in the previous section, we will be performing the following activities in 3scale:
. Creating a new Product and Backend

== Front end visualisation using React and Patternfly 4

In this section you will deploy a UI we've prepared using Patternfly's React components to create a web application to display the latest parking meter and junction traffic information.
PatternFly is an open source design system created to enable consistency and usability across a wide range of applications and use cases.

The Parking Meters page will:

. Display a Google Map
. Render a map marker for each meter
. Cluster the meters when the map is zoomed out
. Support filters for each meter state, e.g show only "available" parking meters

{empty} +

The Traffic Junctions page will:

. Display a Google Map
. Use Heatmap functionality from Google Maps to render traffic conditions

{empty} +

The end result will look similar to the images below. Here's an example of the
Parking Meters being displayed:

{empty} +

image::images/ui-parking-meters.png[role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

{empty} +

And here's the traffic heatmap built using the junction data
